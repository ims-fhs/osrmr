## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Filled out the SystemRequirements field in the DESCRIPTION file.

* Changed the filename of "idea_of_osrmr.jpg" to lower case.

* Not commented out any examples. Instead introduced the "\dontrun{}" Syntax for some examples depending on a local OSRMR installation.

* Added an environment variable "OSRM_PATH" that allows you to store the path to your local OSRM installation.

## Test environments
* local Windows 10 install, R 3.4.3
* local OS X 10.11.6 install, R 3.3.0

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
